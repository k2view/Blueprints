# K2VIEW Infrastructure Blueprints
Welcome to the K2VIEW Infrastructure Blueprints repository. This repository serves as a collection of various infrastructure blueprints that are designed and maintained by K2VIEW's infrastructure team. These blueprints provide pre-defined templates and configurations for setting up and managing different types of environments and architectures.

## Introduction
At K2VIEW, we understand the importance of efficient infrastructure management to support our growing business needs. Infrastructure blueprints are a fundamental part of our infrastructure-as-code approach, enabling us to automate the provisioning and management of our infrastructure components.
